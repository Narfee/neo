A Discord bot that functions as a jack of all trades

# What does neo have to offer?
* A multitude of commands, all built with ease of use and effectiveness in mind
* Bugs are fixed quickly, and updates are pushed regularly
* 30+ base commands, many of which branch off into subcommands
* Customisation on both the guild and user level
* Interfacing with Reddit and more
Plus much more, of course. A full list of commands can be accessed using the `help` command. Note that the bot's default prefix is `n/`, but this can be customised via guild config.
